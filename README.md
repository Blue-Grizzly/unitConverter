Hello this is a small school project made to convert different measurement units.


# To run this program:

First to compile the program make sure you have gcc installed.

Then in your terminal navigate to the unitconverter directory and run the command:
``` 
gcc -o executableNameHere unitConv_main.c
```
If I set the header file correctly the compiler should be smart enough to figure it out with only the main file.

(For windows users you probably have to add the .exe thingy to the end of the executable, I'm not sure I don't have any windows computers at my disposal.)

Next to run the program enter:

```
./executableNameHere
```

Now it should be running.

So far it has been tested on:
 - Arch Linux 6.10.6
 - Debian Linux 12.7

 All with intel processors.
